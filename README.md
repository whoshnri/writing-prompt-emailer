# writing-prompt-emailer
A service that emails me prompts to write articles about every day to build my writing habit (I just had to build one myself)

So basically the flow of this project is simple >> The prompts are generated >> The result is returned into the email file >> The email is constructed and sent to the recipient email

Server credentials are stored in the .env file
